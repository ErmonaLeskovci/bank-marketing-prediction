# Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction (Python)

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer subscription to a bank's term deposit based on campaign data. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##  Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
- ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
   - Balanced the dataset using stratified sampling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize key correlations.
   - Analyzed subscription rates by contact method, duration, job, and more.

3. **Modeling**  
   - Built two models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
   - Compared their performance using accuracy and AUC-ROC.

4. **Results**  
   - Achieved ~80% accuracy.
   - Identified duration, month, and previous outcome as top features.
